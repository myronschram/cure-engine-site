## How We Visualize and Validate the Outcomes

Simulation without clarity is chaos. At The Cure Engine, we don't just model the future — we render it visible. Every prediction, every risk score, every therapeutic insight we generate must be interpretable by the clinicians and researchers who rely on it. This is where the science of modeling meets the art of communication.

In this third post of our series, we step through how The Cure Engine visualizes its outputs in ways that drive real-world decisions. We’ll explore heatmaps, dashboards, projections, and audit loops — not just how they’re built, but why they matter.

## Antigen Escape Heatmaps

Antigen escape is one of the most insidious failure modes in CAR T-cell therapy. Tumor cells, under selective immune pressure, can mutate or downregulate target antigens, rendering the therapy ineffective. The Cure Engine predicts these escape routes before they happen.

Our heatmaps visualize:
- The likelihood of antigen loss over time
- The immune pressure exerted by each CAR construct
- Co-expression and compensation patterns between antigens

By aggregating millions of simulated patient-treatment interactions, we generate a probability landscape — highlighting which antigens are most likely to disappear and when. Clinicians use this to avoid single-target traps and design multi-antigen strategies that stay one step ahead of tumor adaptation.

## Survival Projection Charts

Not every patient sees the same benefit from the same therapy — even in silico.

We simulate thousands of treatment outcomes per synthetic cohort. From these, we generate survival projection curves that mirror Kaplan–Meier plots but reflect the underlying biology, tumor burden, immune profile, and CAR design.

Each projection includes:
- Median predicted survival
- Confidence intervals (e.g. 70%–90%)
- Scenario shading (best vs worst-case)
- Optional overlay of similar past patient trajectories

These charts don’t just show if a therapy works — they show **for whom**, **for how long**, and **how confidently**.

## Toxicity-Risk Overlays

CAR T-cell therapies come with risks: cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS), and other off-target effects. Our engine scores each therapy-patient match against predicted toxicity profiles.

We display:
- Color-coded overlays showing when CRS or ICANS thresholds are likely to be crossed
- Combined immune load and cytokine curves
- Time-based exposure maps linked to co-stimulatory signaling profiles

For clinicians, this means early warning signals — and the ability to tune protocols accordingly.

## Clinician-Centered UI/UX

All of this power is meaningless if buried in complexity. That’s why every visualization in The Cure Engine is designed for clinical and research workflows.

Key principles:
- Interactive dashboards with filtering by antigen, construct, patient type, and risk score
- Exportable reports for tumor boards or IRB submission
- Tooltips that explain terms in plain language
- Glossary overlays, iconography standards, and print-friendly layouts
- Accessible in dark or low-light modes for lab use

We’ve tested early versions with oncologists and nurse practitioners — and iterated based on their feedback.

## Experimental Validation and Audit Trails

Predictions are only as useful as they are trustworthy. We’ve built a validation pipeline that not only compares predicted outcomes to real-world trial data — it tracks every delta, every drift, and every update.

Each simulation:
- Is versioned, timestamped, and tagged with its data lineage
- Includes a confidence score based on model fidelity and retraining frequency
- Can be linked to clinical trial outcomes for benchmarking
- Feeds back into the engine for continuous learning

Our audit trail system ensures that we don’t just explain what the model says — we explain why it said it, and how confident we are.

## Conclusion

Visualization is how simulation becomes medicine.

In a world of complexity, our goal is simplicity — not in the science, but in the story it tells. From heatmaps that warn of antigen escape to charts that project survival with statistical rigor, The Cure Engine transforms data into decisions.

This is how simulation helps save lives — by showing what matters, when it matters most.
