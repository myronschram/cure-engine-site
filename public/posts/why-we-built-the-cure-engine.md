The Cure Engine wasn’t born in a lab, or a boardroom. It was born in a hospital room, next to a boy named Hunter. He was my son. He fought a brain tumor with all the strength in the world, and when the world ran out of options, I made a promise: I would build something different. Something engineered for kids like him.

That’s what The Cure Engine is.

This site marks the first public step in what has so far been a deeply personal mission. We are building a nonprofit focused on designing safer, smarter CAR T-cell therapies for pediatric brain cancers. Using simulation, artificial intelligence, and engineering principles, our goal is to optimize treatment before it ever reaches the lab. Then, with trusted partners in medicine and research, we will validate it, test it, and move it toward something real.

Why a nonprofit? Because this is not a startup. It’s not about exits, valuations, or market fit. It’s about children. It’s about families sitting next to hospital beds, hoping someone is working on something that might help. We answer to those families.

Why the name The Cure Engine? Because engineering is what I know. And building something to cure these tumors will require engineering, science, compassion, and grit. The Engine is our metaphor. It’s a system. A machine we are building piece by piece. It won’t run on code alone. It runs on community. It runs on collaboration. It runs on memory and on promise.

So what now?

Now we assemble a team. We raise funds. We test. We partner. We keep going until a child with a tumor like Hunter's gets a chance he never had.

If you want to be part of it—as a scientist, doctor, donor, or advocate—reach out. We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for people who care, who build, and who don’t give up.

This site is for you.
This mission is for Hunter.
This engine is just getting started.
